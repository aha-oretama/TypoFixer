# TypoFixer

In a pull request, **TypoFixer** points out your typos instead of reviewers, and fixes typo by just selecting the suggestions to fix!

1. When you create or update the pull request, *TypoFixer* checks it and make review comments if there are typos.
2. If there is a suitable word in the suggestions, you select it. Then *TypoFixer* fixes typo and updates your pull request.
3. If the word pointed out is not typo, you select `Not Typo`. Then *TypoFIxer* registers in dictionary and never point out the word as typo.
